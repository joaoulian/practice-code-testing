# Practice Coding Test

The objective of this task is to develop a code that retrieves data from the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) (Star Wars API). The requirements are as follows:
1. Retrieve and display a list of characters using the "/people" endpoint.
2. Implement pagination to display characters from each individual page.
3. Include two buttons to navigate between pages: a previous button and a next button.
4. Disable the buttons when there is no additional data available through pagination.


## Requirements
1. It is preferable to use JavaScript or TypeScript.
2. You are free to choose any library for implementation (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) or use plain JavaScript.
3. The focus of this task is on the code that interacts with the API; CSS styling is not necessary.

## Steps to Follow
1. Fork this repository to create your own copy.
2. Develop your solution.
3. Push your changes to your forked repository.
4. Open a pull request (PR) to submit your solution to this repository.

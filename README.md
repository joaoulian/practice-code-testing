# practice code testing

The goal of this test is writting a code that consume the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/). The requirements below:

1. you should list all characters using the `/people` endpoint
2. you should use the pagination system to show the list of characters from each indivudual page
3. it should include at least two buttons, where we can navigate between pages (previous button and next button)
4. the buttons should be disabled invidually when there is no way to get more data using the pagination


## requirements
1. it is preferable use javascript or typescript
2. you can write the solution using any library of your choice (React, Vue, Angular, etc) or in vanila JS
3. this solution does not need any CSS to make the output nicer, the main goal is the code that consumes the API

## how shoud I do
1. create a fork from this repository
2. code your solution
3. push and open a PR to this repository
